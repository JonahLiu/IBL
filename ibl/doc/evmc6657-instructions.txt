Steps to use IBL on the c6657 EVM

1. Programing "IBL" on the EEPROM at bus address 0x51
   (a) Use the I2C EEPROM writer for c6657 EVM from the MCSDK distribution.
   (b) Program i2crom_0x51_c6657_le.bin (IBL image) to the EEPROM at I2C BUS 
       address 0x51 following the EEPROM writer's procedure.

2. Programming the application on NAND or NOR flash
   NOTE: This step is not needed if the application is booted from Ethernet.
   (a) Use the NAND or NOR writer c6657 EVM from the tools directory.
   (a) Flash the Application to NAND or NOR. For instructions please follow 
       the instructions given along with the NAND/NOR writer.

3. Booting the Application using IBL
   Supported boot modes:
   IBL supports three I2C boot modes: NOR boot, NAND boot and EMAC boot. 
   Both NOR boot and NAND boot support maximum 2 images, EMAC boot supports only 1 image. 
   For all the I2C boot modes, user needs to set the boot dip switches to I2C master, bus address 0x51.

   NOR Boot:
   Set the dip switches (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4, pin5, pin6, pin7, pin8) to: 

    SW3(off, off, on, off, on, on, on, on), 
    SW5(on, on, on, off, on, on, on, on),
    
   This will set the boot param index to 0 to boot the NOR image, by default
   the boot configuration table sets the NOR offset address to be 0 and 
   image format to be ELF for image 0.
   
   NAND Boot:
   Set the dip switches (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4, pin5, pin6, pin7, pin8) to: 
    
    SW3(off, off, on, off, on, off, on, on), 
    SW5(on, on, on, off, on, on, on, on),

   This will set the boot param index to 2 to boot the NAND image, by default
   the boot configuration table sets the NAND offset address to be 16384 
   (start of block 1) and image format to be BBLOB for image 0.

   EMAC Boot:
   Set the dip switches (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4, pin5, pin6, pin7, pin8) to: 
    
    SW3(off, off, on, off, on, on, off, on), 
    SW5(on, on, on, off, on, on, on, on),

   This will set the boot param index to 4 to boot an image from a remote TFTP
   server, by default the boot configuration table sets the server IP to be 
   192.168.2.101, board IP to be 192.168.2.100 and image format to be BBLOB.
